Game Points Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Focusing on structure rather than UI-features :)

Added a simple test to top component and the most complex of the reducer functions-
If it was to be a more than a simple UI Demo I would have written more tests to reach acceptable code coverage levels.

Install node modules for project by typing `npm install`

Start the app by running `npm start`
